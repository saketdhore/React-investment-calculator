# ðŸ’° Investment Calculator

A self-built investment calculator app that helps visualize how your investments grow over time based on user inputs like initial savings, yearly contribution, expected return, and investment duration.

This project was built from scratch, where I applied the core React concepts I learned through tutorials and follow-alongs.

## ðŸš€ What I Built & Practiced

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: UI updates in real-time based on user inputs.
- **Component-Based Design**: Clean separation of UI into reusable components.
- **React State Management**: Managing form inputs and computed results using `useState`.
- **Controlled Components**: Two-way binding for form fields.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying result table only after form submission.
- **Custom Logic**: Investment growth calculated using compound interest formulas.
